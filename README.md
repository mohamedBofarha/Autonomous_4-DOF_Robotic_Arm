Project Title: Development and Control of a Robotic Arm

Project Description:

The ARM Robotics project aims to design and develop an autonomous robotic arm capable of performing precise manipulation tasks in a controlled environment. This robotic arm integrates advanced principles of kinematics, control, and industrial robotics to simulate object manipulation applications in various contexts, such as production lines or research environments.

The arm is equipped with multiple joints and sensors to detect and respond to its surroundings. The primary objective is to implement control algorithms 
to ensure precise and smooth movements while optimizing the performance of the robotic arm. This project involves the kinematic and dynamic modeling of the
 arm, as well as the development of strategies for navigation and object grasping.

Project Objectives:

Design a functional model of a multi-degree-of-freedom (DOF) robotic arm.
Implement real-time control algorithms for precise object manipulation.
Use sensors to detect the position and orientation of objects to be manipulated.
Develop a user interface to remotely control the robotic arm and define specific tasks.
Test and validate the arm's performance in various manipulation applications.
Technologies Used:

Hardware: Servo motors, position sensors, control board (e.g., STM32, Raspberry Pi).
Software: Programming in Python, C++, ROS (Robot Operating System), simulation with Gazebo or V-REP.
Control Algorithms: PID, KDL (Kinematics and Dynamics Library), trajectory-based control.
Simulation and Modeling: MATLAB, SolidWorks, or CAD software for 3D design.
Possible Applications:

Industrial automation for object manipulation in assembly lines.
Service robotics for applications in unstructured environments.
Research in autonomous robotics and embedded systems.
This project will not only deepen theoretical and practical knowledge in robotics but also provide a solid foundation for the development of more complex 
industrial or research robots.
